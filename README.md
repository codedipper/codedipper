# About Me
Hey everyone! My name is codedipper, but you can call me Reverse.\
I do crazy and stupid things with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, node.js, and some Python!\
I am a Discord bot and web developer, I open source half my projects and hope to see you around there soon!
# My Best Work
My [python number chooser](https://github.com/codedipper/python-number-chooser) is my first Python project.\
My [website template](https://github.com/codedipper/js-website-template) is extremely simple with a cool hamburger menu.\
My [Discord pinger bot](https://github.com/codedipper/auto-pinger-dev) uses a constructor to make bots to easily build up your pings in Discord.
