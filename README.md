# My Story
I had a dream, and I was constantly looking for a way to fall nicely into coding skills.\
I was having many troubles understanding, code but that all changed November 3rd 2019.\
One video on YouTube inspired me and taught me the basics of HTML.\
Soon, I started exploring other languages and tools like CSS, node.js, JavaScript, and now I'm learning Python.\
The moral of the story is, never give up and stay confident to achieve your dreams.
# My Best Work
My [python number chooser](https://github.com/codedipper/python-number-chooser) is my first Python project.\
My [website template](https://github.com/codedipper/js-website-template) is extremely simple with a cool hamburger menu.\
My [Discord pinger bot](https://github.com/codedipper/auto-pinger-dev) uses a constructor to make bots to easily build up your pings in Discord.
