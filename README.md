# About Me
Hey everyone! My name is codedipper, but you can call me Reverse.\
I live in Canada, and I like innovating my code to make it as easy as possible for non-developers!\
I open-source half my projects and I hope to see around there soon!

# My Story
I had a dream, and I was constantly looking for a way to fall nicely into coding skills.\
I was having many troubles understanding code, but that all changed November 3rd 2019.\
One video on YouTube inspired me and taught me the basics of HTML.\
Soon, I started exploring other languages and tools like CSS, node.js, JavaScript, and now I'm learning Python.\
The moral of the story is, never give up, you can do it.
# My Best Work
My [random code generator](https://github.com/codedipper/random-code) is my most popular and only NPM package.\
My [random number generator](https://github.com/codedipper/python-number-chooser) is written in Python and is my first Python project.\
My [knockoff MS Paint](https://github.com/codedipper/draw) is my take at a paint program in the browser.
