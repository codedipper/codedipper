# About Me
Hey everyone! My name is codedipper, but you can call me Reverse.\
I live in Canada, and I like innovating my code to make it as easy as possible for non-developers!\
I open-source half my projects and I hope to see around there soon!

# My Story
I had a dream, and I was constantly looking for a way to fall nicely into coding skills.\
I was having many troubles understanding code, but that all changed November 3rd 2019.\
One video on YouTube inspired me and taught me the basics of HTML.\
Soon, I started exploring other languages and tools like CSS, node.js, JavaScript, and now I'm learning Python.\
The moral of the story is, never give up and stay confident to achieve your dreams.
# My Best Work
My [python calculator](https://github.com/codedipper/python-calculator) is my best Python project that nobody cares about.\
My [website template](https://github.com/codedipper/js-website-template) is extremely simple with a cool hamburger menu.\
My [Discord pinger bot](https://github.com/codedipper/auto-pinger-dev) uses a constructor to make bots to easily build up your pings in Discord.
